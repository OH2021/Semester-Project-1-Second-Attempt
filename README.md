## Description

This is a website that displays and gives information on 4 of my favourite/helpful/practical websites. 

Each website has a dedicated page where you can click and read about what the different websites do and why they're one of my favourites. 

Every page has a screenshot image of the website that's being showcased to show what the website looks like. The images have been improved so that the loading time of each page doesn't take long.
