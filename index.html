            <h4 class="home-text">My four websites contains of practical functionallity for the most part. I've also seen tech people on social media recomend these websites before so I think these four websites actually are pretty decent. In general they're quite handy and
                practical for anyone. However, I do belive that not so many actually know about them. If you don't know any of these websites, I'll explain with a short text in each page on this website what these four websites do and why they're so practical.
                These websites are alternative.me, edx.org, flexjobs.com and iloveimg.com and the logo of each website is show down below.
