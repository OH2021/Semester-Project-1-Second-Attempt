            <h4 class="flexjobs-text">Flexjobs.com is a website where you can find jobs on the internet. Of course there are other websites that can do the same, but flexjobs.com focuses on remote and flexible jobs. I haven't tested it out and gotten a job via flexjobs myself,
                however I've browsed the jobs they have on their site and it looks tidy and understandable. I don't have to click on every job advertisement to see if it's a job for me or not because they list the jobs in a way that makes it easy to see
                if it'll fit you from just the ad when you are scrolling. Like if it's part-time or full-time, if it's a "100% Remote Job" or "Hybrid Remote Job", where they're stationed/nationnallity and so on. You can also filter the jobs by the different
                tools at the top to narrow down the search.
